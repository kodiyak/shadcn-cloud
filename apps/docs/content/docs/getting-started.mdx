## 2. Understanding "Forking"

In [Platform Name], "forking" is the primary way to start a new project from an existing template. Think of it as creating a **personal, editable copy** of a template.

* **Original Template:** The original template remains unchanged and available for everyone.
* **Your Fork:** Your fork is entirely yours. You can modify it, experiment with it, and prepare it for publishing without affecting the original.

This process gives you a starting point and full freedom to customize.

## 3. Creating Your First Project (Forking a Template)

Follow these steps to create your first editable project:

1.  **Navigate to the Explore Section:**
    * From your [PLACEHOLDER: e.g., Dashboard/Home page], click on the "[Explore Link Text]" link in the navigation bar. [PLACEHOLDER: Link to /explore page: `/explore`].
    * Here you'll find a wide range of components and templates.

2.  **Choose Your Template:**
    * Browse through the available templates or use the search bar to find one that suits your needs.
    * Click on a template's card to view its details.

3.  **Fork the Template:**
    * On the template's detail page, you'll see a prominent "[Fork Button Text]" button. [PLACEHOLDER: Screenshot of button location].
    * Click this button. If you're not logged in, you'll be prompted to do so before the fork is created.

4.  **Enter the Editor:**
    * After a successful fork, you will automatically be redirected to the project's editing environment in your library. This is where you'll bring your ideas to life!
